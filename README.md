This repository demonstrates a common C++ error: dereferencing a null pointer. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to write to memory pointed to by a null pointer.  This often results in a segmentation fault or crash. The `bugSolution.cpp` file shows the corrected code which first checks if the pointer is null before dereferencing it, preventing the error.  This example highlights the importance of robust null pointer checks in C++.
